    "\n",
    "Because of the independence assumption, naive Bayes classifiers can quickly learn to use high dimensional features with limited training data compared to more sophisticated methods. This can be useful in situations where the dataset is small compared to the number of features, such as images or texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computational efficiency of Naive Bayes lies in the fact that the runtime complexity of Naive Bayes classifier is $O(nK)$ , where n is the number of features and K is the number of label classes. This is especially useful in dealing with very high dimensional data, such as a large-corpus text dataset, or a high-resolution image dataset."
